        <li>Do not confuse the rxFieldName element with an HTML label element.
          <ul>
            <li>rxFieldName is a descriptive design element for a particular form field.</li>
            <li>An HTML label is used for accessibility.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Please use the <code>&lt;label for="formControlId"&gt;</code> format when defining your HTML labels.
          <ul>
            <li>
              The <code>for</code> attribute connects the label to an appropriate form control so that when the label is clicked
              (wherever it is placed in the DOM), it will focus or activate its corresponding form control.

              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Most of the time, an HTML label should be placed around text in an appropriate rxFieldName element.</li>
            <li>Inline HTML label elements should only be used with radios, checkboxes, and toggle switches.
              <ul>
                <li>Place the label <strong>immediately after the form control</strong>.
                  <ul>
                    <li>This allows developers/designers to style the label based on the state of the control.</li>

          In contrast to its predecessor (rxFormItem), rxField and children provide the flexibility to create form field inputs that make use

          <ul>
            <li>
              In a nutshell, submit buttons should use the green <code>submit</code>
              class unless you are performing a destructive action, in which case, you
              should use the <code>negative</code> class.

    <h3 class="title">Using a Character Counter</h3>
    <div class="component-description">
      <ul class="list">
        <li>
          Character counters provide color feedback to the user in addition to numeric feedback. As a user approaches
          the character limit, the numeric value turns from gray to yellow, then yellow to red.
        </li>
        <li>
          The framework provides styles for a character counter, including a generic wrapper
          (<code>.counted-input-wrapper</code>) with the proper width needed to position the character counter in
          relation to a textarea.  Note that if you need a different textarea width for specific use cases in a
          project, a custom wrapper class and textarea width can be set.
        </li>
        <li>
          Counters are most often used with textareas, where there is enough space for a user to type several sentences.
          However, there are places where it has been used on text inputs, as well. If you are going to use
          rxCharacterCount on any input other than <code>textarea</code> or <code>input[type="text"]</code>,
          be aware that the framework was not designed to support these fields and you may experience unexpected results.
          Please test your code heavily before shipping.
        </li>
        <li>
          See <a href="#/components/rxCharacterCount/">rxCharacterCount</a> for more specific documentation about
          implementing a counter on a textarea or text input field.

          When an input is disabled, styles are automatically applied to gray out
          the field with a "not-allowed" pointer style.
        </li>
        <li>
          When label rules (seen above) are applied correctly to a radio, checkbox,
          or toggle switch, the label will also get some styling.

    <h3 class="title">Form Validation</h3>
    <div class="component-description">
      <ul class="list">
        <li>
          Because Encore is built on Angular, we leverage ngModel directives used for validation.
          As a result, the EncoreUI framework has custom CSS styling if an element has the
          "ng-invalid" and/or "ng-dirty" classes (which are dynamically added by ngModel validation logic).
        </li>
        <li>Some components will style based on both classes, while others will only use <code>ng-invalid</code>.</li>
        <li><strong>NOTE:</strong> Creating an EncoreUI-specific design pattern for placement of form validation messages is on our roadmap.</li>
        <li><strong class="msg-info">NOTE:</strong> At present, there are no styles for invalid toggle switches.</li>

    <div class="component-description">
      <ul class="list">
        <li>
          When a user is filling out a form, it often makes sense to automatically save the state of that form,
          in case they navigate away and want to return and continue. The framework has support for this with the
          rxAutoSave service.
        </li>
        <li>rxAutoSave interacts exclusively with your model layer. Your UI/template code will be unaware that its state is being saved.</li>

        <li>The notification should be put in the page stack and should only be shown after a change has been made to the form (e.g. not on page load).</li>
